# RustLang
Programming in Rust . From understanding the basics with examples to popular data structures and algorithms implemented in Rust . 


## Goals : 

1. Basic Rust syntax,data types ,types , functions, control flow and modules 
2. Advanced Rust concepts like Generics , Scoping Rules, Borrowing, Error Handling 
3. Mastering the Standard Libraries 
4. Common Data Structures like Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked List , Graphs implementation 
5. Implementation of Algorithms for Searching , Sorting , Traversal(Graphs, Trees ) etc. in rust


and then i can probably add Rust to my Resume
